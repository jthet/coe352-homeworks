# Homework 5

This directory contains a Python script `galerkin.pu1` and `lagrangian.py` that preform the galerkin and lagrangian finite element approximations on a 1 dimensional grid [0, 1].

## Question 1:
1) (20 pts) Use a uniform four-element mesh on [0, 1] and piecewise Lagrangian
linear finite element basis functions to construct a finite element interpolant, fh of
the function f (x) = sin(πx), that is, set the values fh(xi) = sin(πxi), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and plot the function f and fh.

See `lagrangian.py`

Here is the plot:
